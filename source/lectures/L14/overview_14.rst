Lecture Contents
================

Lecture 14 is all about Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). We will create with the help og TensorFlow and Keras a CNN which does the character recognition we developed in the lectures before. In a second example, we will use a CNN to denoise data with a structure, which is a so called autoencoder. With these two examples, we close our machine learning endeavour.

1. Convolutional Neural Networks (MNIST classification)
2. Autoencoders (Denoising Timeseries)

The video will this time come a bit later. As I saw that most of you are still behind with some of the other videos :-), this may be a welcome thing.
