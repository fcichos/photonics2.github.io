Assignments
============


Since this years lecture will be held completely online, we will supply problem sets every week to all students. The assignments come as a Jupyter Notebook, with individual problems. Please fill in the code or answers your are asked for and return the notebooks **before the lecture** every Tuesday morning. More details on where you can find the notebooks for the assignments will be available at course start.
