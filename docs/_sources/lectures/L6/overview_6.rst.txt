Lecture Contents
================

In this 6th lecture we will have a look at

1. COVID19 models and data
2. Coupled Pendula
3. Fourier Analysis 

The video and the lecture will be in its final form available on the May, 12th. I'm still a bit behind with updating my comments to the assignment.
But they will come. Please also check out the assignment page of lecture 4 again. I will publish a video on the COVID19 simulation for those who have not managed to get the simulation running.
